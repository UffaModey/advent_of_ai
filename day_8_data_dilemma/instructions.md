Dmitri, a consultant, has an app that needs food vendor data, but the information he currently has is unusable. It looks more like a crumpled paper map with hot cocoa stains than real data!

Your task is to convert this messy list into a proper, structured format that the app can use. The data must be clean, consistent, and ready for developers to work with.

- Build a simple HTML web page that displays json data
- The data  should be parsed from the output of a python script
- Create an HTTP server that serves the data
- messy data is stored in this directory messy_vendor_list.txt
- Take the messy vendor list 
- Use goose to clean and structure it
- get goose to output machine-readable data (json)
- Save it to a file with a silly name eg dmitris-definitely-not-a-disaster.json, hot-cocoa-stain-free-data.json, dmitris-sanity-saver.json, no-more-napkin-notes.json, taco-truck-locator-supreme.json
- Goals
  - turn messy data into clean, parseable data
  - get structured output from goose
  - web app that uses the output
  - save output file with a silly filename
