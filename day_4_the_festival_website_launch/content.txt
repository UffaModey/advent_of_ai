✨ HIGHLIGHTS FROM THIS YEAR
🔮 1. The Fortune Teller’s Tent

Step inside a candle-lit tent and receive a personalized winter fortune from our mystical guide, Aurora Faye. Visitors left with insights, smiles, and magical predictions for the year ahead.

📖 2. The Storyteller’s Booth

Stories came alive through interactive, choose-your-own-adventure tales. Guests shaped the narrative with their choices — from snowy quests to cozy fireside mysteries.

Local chocolatiers went head-to-head in this year’s sweetest competition. Attendees tasted, voted, and crowned the champion of the creamiest, dreamiest winter cocoa.
